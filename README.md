[![CI](https://github.com/processone/eturnal/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)][1]

[eturnal][2] is a modern, straightforward STUN and TURN server. For
authentication, the mechanism described in the [REST API for Access to TURN
Services][3] specification is implemented. The server can easily be tested [in a
Linux shell][4] or [using Docker][5]. For a persistent installation, see the
following section.

## Installation

> _Note:_ Running eturnal in **container environments** such as Docker or
> Kubernetes is described on a [separate documentation][6] page.

On **APT-based** Linux distributions, run:

    sudo apt install extrepo
    sudo extrepo enable eturnal
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install eturnal

On **DNF-based** Linux distributions, run:

    sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://eturnal.net/eturnal.repo
    sudo dnf install eturnal
    sudo systemctl --now enable eturnal

On **YUM-based** Linux distributions, run:

    sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://eturnal.net/eturnal.repo
    sudo yum install eturnal
    sudo systemctl --now enable eturnal

On SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE systems, [distribution repositories][7]
can be used instead. There's also an official [Alpine package][8]. On other
Linux systems, the binary release can be installed as [described][9] in the
reference documentation. For Windows, an installer is [available][10].

On **macOS** using homebrew's

    brew tap processone/eturnal https://github.com/processone/eturnal
    brew install processone/eturnal/eturnal

On other platforms, eturnal is [built from source][11].

## Configuration

The eturnal server is configured by editing the `/etc/eturnal.yml` file. This
file uses the (indentation-sensitive!) [YAML][12] format. For TURN relaying to
work, you'll have to specify the [shared authentication][3] `secret` and (if
autodetection fails) also the `relay_ipv4_addr` option, which should be set to
the server's _external_ IPv4 address. As an example, a configuration for
offering STUN and TURN services on port 3478 (UDP and TCP) might look like
this:

```yaml
eturnal:
  secret: "long-and-cryptic"     # Shared secret, CHANGE THIS.
  relay_ipv4_addr: "203.0.113.4" # The server's public IPv4 address.
  relay_ipv6_addr: "2001:db8::4" # The server's public IPv6 address (optional).
```

A more detailed, commented [example configuration][13] is shipped with the
eturnal server.

## Running eturnal

On Linux systems, the eturnal server is usually invoked by [systemd][14]. For
non-systemd platforms, example [init][15] and [OpenRC][16] scripts are shipped
below the `etc` directory.

For controlling eturnal, the `eturnalctl` command can be used; see:

    eturnalctl help

## Logging

If eturnal was started by systemd, log files are written into the
`/var/log/eturnal` directory by default. In order to log to the [journal][17]
instead, the `log_dir` option can be set to `stdout` in the configuration file.

## Documentation

For a detailed description of eturnal's configuration options and the
`eturnalctl` tool, see the [reference documentation][18]. For notable changes
between eturnal releases, see the [change log][19].

## Feedback/Support

Please use [our issue tracker][20] for bug reports and feature requests. Feel
free to (ab)use it for usage questions as well. If you happen to be using
[XMPP][21], you could also join our public room
`eturnal@conference.process-one.net`. Otherwise, just use the [web client][22].
As an alternative, there's an `#eturnal` channel [on Slack][23].
