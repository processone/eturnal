#  File containing the...
#     container image version
#  ...to create and update container-image releases (see github workflows)
#
#  Usage:
#    Case 1) New eturnal release/tag with x.x.x
#      * the container image version will be x.x.x-r0 ('r0'-suffix is adopted from AlpineLinux package versioning)
#
#    Case 2) Container image update, eturnal release remains as in the first case
#      * only necessary, e.g. if (relevant) vulnerabilities in image packages have been detected
#      * only the suffix of the container image version is updated,
#        e.g. x.x.x-r1, x.x.x-r2, etc.
#
#  Hint:
#  The github action "tails" the last line of this file to extract the relevant release and tags.

1.10.1-r2
