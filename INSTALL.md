# Building eturnal From Source

## Requirements

- [Erlang/OTP][1] (21.0 or newer).
- [LibYAML][2] (0.1.4 or newer).
- [OpenSSL][3] (1.0.0 or newer).
- [GCC][4] (other C compilers might work as well).

Note that you need the development headers of the libraries as well. Linux
distributions often put those into separate `*-dev` or `*-devel` packages. For
example, on DEB-based distributions you'd typically install `libyaml-dev` and
`libssl-dev`, on RPM-based distributions you'll probably need `libyaml-devel`
and `openssl-devel`.

## Compilation

> _Note:_ If you build directly from the Git repository rather than using the
> official source tarball, you must [download Rebar3][5] and make it executable
> (`chmod +x rebar3`), first. On Erlang/OTP 21.x and 22.x, you need an [older
> Rebar3][6] version.

    curl https://eturnal.net/eturnal-1.10.1.tar.gz | tar -C /tmp -xzf -
    cd /tmp/eturnal-1.10.1
    ./rebar3 as prod tar

This generates the archive file `_build/prod/rel/eturnal/eturnal-1.10.1.tar.gz`.
The default installation prefix is set to `/opt/eturnal`, and it's assumed the
server will be executed by a user named `eturnal`. To change these defaults,
edit the [build.config][7] file or override the settings using environment
variables (of the same name, but upper-case), re-run `./rebar3 as prod tar`, and
adapt the following installation instructions accordingly.

## Quick Test

The following command starts the server in an Erlang shell, [using][8] the
configuration in [config/eturnal.yml][9]:

    $ ./rebar3 shell

To stop the server, enter `q().` (including the trailing dot).

## Installation

You'll need root privileges for the following commands. Therefore, call `su -`
or `sudo -i`, first.

1.  Create a user for running eturnal. This step is of course only required if
    you're installing eturnal for the first time:

        useradd -r -m -d /opt/eturnal eturnal

    Otherwise, **create a backup** of the old installation, first:

        tar -czf /opt/eturnal-$(date '+%F').tar.gz /opt/eturnal

2.  Extract the archive generated [above](#compilation):

        cd /opt/eturnal
        tar -xzf /tmp/eturnal-1.10.1/_build/prod/rel/eturnal/eturnal-1.10.1.tar.gz
        chown eturnal /opt/eturnal/etc/eturnal.yml

3.  Copy the `eturnal.yml` file to `/etc` (optional):

        cp -p -i /opt/eturnal/etc/eturnal.yml /etc/

4.  Start the systemd service:

        cp /opt/eturnal/etc/systemd/system/eturnal.service /etc/systemd/system/
        systemctl daemon-reload
        systemctl --now enable eturnal
